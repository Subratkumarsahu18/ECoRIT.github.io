During our summer internship at East Coast Railway, Bhubaneswar, We Developed a web application for a Closed User Group using React and Firebase. 
The app features seamless file upload functionality, data storage in Firestore, and real-time updates. Ideal for managing and sharing documents within a secure, private group.
We conducted research and collaborated with our team members to troubleshoot and resolve technical issues, improving overall 
project efficiency.
